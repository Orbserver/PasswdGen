## PasswdGen
Temporal Pattern Password Generator for WLAN Networks

This Python script enables automated generation of passwords following a specific temporal pattern. The generated passwords are based on a unique combination of characters and numbers provided by the user. Designed to enrich password dictionaries, the script facilitates the creation of passwords tailored to patterns from recent years, making it useful for security testing and assessments of WLAN networks. The tool is versatile and can contribute to enhancing the robustness of security testing for specific environments.

I only consider the last 6 years in the script. I welcome suggestions to enhance the script. 

Here is an Example:
String: companyname
Start year: 2018
Ending year: 2020

...
cOMpanyname2018
cOMpanyname2019
cOMpanyname2020
cOMPanyname2018
cOMPanyname2019
cOMPanyname2020
cOMPAnyname2018
cOMPAnyname2019
cOMPAnyname2020
cOMPANyname2018
